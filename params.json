We have a PoC(Point of Concept) of PureDarwin 2.2 qemu image that's based on from Apple's OpenSource Code of [macOS 10.10.5](http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10105/) that is only currently available to those who join our IRC channel #puredarwin on freenode. \r\n\r\nWe are currently working on getting a base Image of PureDarwin 3.6 that's based on from Apple's OpenSource Code of [macOS 10.11.6](http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10116/)\r\n\r\nWe are looking for Supporters/Coders that can help bring about faster Development of PureDarwin while showing Apple that there is still a Community of Open Source Darwin Supporters that would like to see more openness from them whether it be from them releasing Binary formed Drivers for our use as they once did or open source projects like libxpc/launchd again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank\r\n-   Apple, Inc. for releasing Darwin as Open Source \r\n-   kvv and _wms for their continuing help\r\n-   Adam Baxter for finding a Gold Sponsor to provide a hosted Mac mini from [MacStadium](http://www.macstadium.com)\r\n-   David Elliott for his work on boot-132\r\n-   The Chameleon team for their work on boot-132\r\n-   The xnu-dev team for their work on the XNU kernel\r\n-   Stuart Crook for his work on PureFoundation\r\n-   Guillaume Verdeau for his work on X.Org\r\n-   [Rafirafi](https://github.com/rafirafi) for his work on Generic Platform kexts\r\n-   [Clifford Sekel](https://github.com/csekel/) aka IRC InSaneDarwin for his work on AHCI and NVMe Family/Drivers(still in active development)\r\n-   Mac OS Forge \r\n-   The DarwinBuild project \r\n-   The MacPorts project\r\n-   The folks at #macosforge, #macports, #macdev, #opendarwin, #puredarwin, \r\n-   Everyone else contributing to Darwin \r\n\r\nGold Sponsor\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [MacStadium](http://www.macstadium.com) for sponsoring a hosted Mac mini.\r\n\r\n![MacStadium](http://www.macstadium.com/images/macstadium210.png)",
