We have a PoC(Point of Concept) of PureDarwin 2.2 qemu image that's based on from Apple's OpenSource Code of [macOS 10.10.5](http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10105/) that is only currently available to those who join our IRC channel #puredarwin on freenode. \r\n\r\nWe are currently working on getting a base Image of PureDarwin 3.6 that's based on from Apple's OpenSource Code of [macOS 10.11.6](http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10116/)\r\n\r\nWe are looking for Supporters/Coders that can help bring about faster Development of PureDarwin while showing Apple that there is still a Community of Open Source Darwin Supporters that would like to see more openness from them whether it be from them releasing Binary formed Drivers for our use as they once did or open source projects like libxpc/launchd again.\r\n\r\nFaq's\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWhat is Darwin?\r\n\r\nDarwin is the Open Source operating\r\nsystem from Apple that forms the\r\nbasis for Mac OS X, and PureDarwin is\r\na community project to make Darwin\r\nmore usable (some people think of it\r\nas the informal successor to OpenDarwin).\r\n\r\nWhat is PureDarwin?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to make\r\nDarwin more usable by providing an\r\ninstallation ISO, documentation, and\r\nadd-on software. You are welcome to\r\njoin #puredarwin on irc.freenode.net\r\nif you would like to join PureDarwin\r\ndevelopment and to add to\r\nwww.puredarwin.org\r\n\r\nHow usable is PureDarwin?\r\n\r\nPureDarwin can run on VMware as well\r\nas real Intel-based hardware. We are\r\nsuccessfully running a web server, have\r\nbuilt hundreds of software packages\r\nwith MacPorts running on PureDarwin,\r\nincluding ssh, apache2, tightvnc, Xfce,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nWhy spend time on Darwin?\r\n\r\nFor learning and fun.\r\n\r\nHow does PureDarwin relate to the\r\nformer OpenDarwin project?\r\n\r\nAlthough some people have been\r\nseeing PureDarwin as the informal\r\nsuccessor to OpenDarwin, there is no\r\nofficial relationship other than the fact\r\nthat OpenDarwin and PureDarwin are\r\nboth downstream Darwin projects.\r\nAlso, it is no secret that PureDarwin\r\nwould not exist if OpenDarwin had not\r\nclosed down. Coming later in time,\r\nPureDarwin is in the fortunate position\r\nto be able to benefit from the valuable\r\ncontributions that were rooted in the\r\nOpenDarwin project.\r\n\r\nHow does PureDarwin relate to the\r\nDarwinBuild project?\r\n\r\nDarwinBuild is one of PureDarwin‘s\r\nmain upstream projects.\r\n\r\nWhat does the „Pure“ in PureDarwin\r\nstand for?\r\n\r\nPure as in beer! It means that we just\r\nuse components specifically released\r\nby Apple for use with Darwin, as well\r\nas other Open Source components\r\n(collectively called „upstream code“).\r\nSpecifically, it means that we do not\r\nuse any components from Mac OS X. It\r\nalso means that we try to stay as close\r\nas possible to the „outside world“ as in\r\nMac OS X (e.g., regarding the choice\r\nof compilers, options, etc.). It does not\r\nmean, however, that we do not modify\r\nand add to the upstream code, to\r\nthe extent that the respective licenses\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nHow can I help PureDarwin?\r\n\r\nPretty much on all fronts. Especially if\r\nyou are skilled in C, C++, ObjC, Mac OS\r\nX, BSD, etc. you should consider joining\r\n#puredarwin on irc.freenode.net\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank\r\n-   Apple, Inc. for releasing Darwin as Open Source \r\n-   kvv and _wms for their continuing help\r\n-   David Elliott for his work on boot-132\r\n-   The Chameleon team for their work on boot-132\r\n-   The xnu-dev team for their work on the XNU kernel\r\n-   Stuart Crook for his work on PureFoundation\r\n-   Guillaume Verdeau for his work on X.Org\r\n-   [Rafirafi](https://github.com/rafirafi) for his work on Generic Platform kexts\r\n-   [Clifford Sekel](https://github.com/csekel/) aka IRC InSaneDarwin for his work on AHCI and NVMe Family/Drivers(still in active development)\r\n-   Mac OS Forge \r\n-   The DarwinBuild project \r\n-   The MacPorts project\r\n-   The folks at #macosforge, #macports, #macdev, #opendarwin, #puredarwin, \r\n-   Everyone else contributing to Darwin \r\n\r\nSponsor's\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPureDarwin is currently Looking for Sponsor's that could provide a Mac Pro or VM of Cloud macOS Instance that we could allow our projects to build. Please join us on freenode.net #puredarwin\r\n",
