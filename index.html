<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29">Darwin</a> is the Open Source operating system from Apple that forms the basis for macOS, and PureDarwin is a community project to make Darwin more usable (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin).</p>

<p>One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable IMG and Virtual of Darwin 10.x
Another goal of this project is to provide additional documentation. <a href="wiki/About">More</a>...</p>

<h2>
<a id="documentation-and-quick-hints" class="anchor" href="#documentation-and-quick-hints" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation and quick hints</h2>

<p>Please see our <a href="">PureDarwin Wiki</a> It would be very kind if you could fix the wiki in this case.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/wiki/_history">Changelog</a> for recent updates of this Wiki.</p>

<h2>
<a id="new-getting-the-code" class="anchor" href="#new-getting-the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>NEW!</em> Getting the code</h2>

<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/PureDarwin/">GitHub</a>, and encourage visitors to use the GitHub repository for both contribution, and checking out the latest build source. </p>

<p>Additionally, as an interim measure, a <a href="https://github.com/PureDarwin/LegacyDownloads/releases/download/PDXMASNBE01/NewBootEnvironment-XMas-1.7z">version of PureDarwin Xmas</a> with a fixed boot sector, which is compatible with QEMU is also available. </p>

<h2>
<a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h2>

<p>PureDarwin is currently working on AHCI and NVMe family/drivers for Darwin only they will not support/work on Apple's macOS. We have a PoC(Point of Concept) of PureDarwin 2.2 qemu image that's based on from Apple's OpenSource Code of <a href="http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10105/">macOS 10.10.5</a> that is only currently available to those who join our IRC channel #puredarwin on freenode. </p>

<p>We are currently working on getting a base Image of PureDarwin 3.6 that's based on from Apple's OpenSource Code of <a href="http://opensource.apple.com/release/os-x-10116/">macOS 10.11.6</a></p>

<p>We are looking for Supporters/Coders that can help bring about faster Development of PureDarwin while showing Apple that there is still a Community of Open Source Darwin Supporters that would like to see more openness from them whether it be from them releasing Binary formed Drivers for our use as they once did or open source projects like libxpc/launchd again.</p>
